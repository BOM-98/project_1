## Table of Contents

The Startup Academy is a blog for guiding new founders on best practices for achieving product-market fit. The blog is targeted towards startup founders, particularly new founders in Dublin, Ireland. The goal of the website is to distill as much knowledge as possible into articles and present them in a logical order for founders to follow. If a founder is running a company that is already past some of the stages discussed in the blog, they can easily navigate and identify what the next problem area they should explore would be.

## Features

The Startup Academy website features a dedicated homepage where founders can instantly navigate to all the relevant resources contained on the site. This includes a responsive navigation bar, a tab section where users can toggle between blog content to arrive at the area most relevant to them, a form to sign up to the newsletter, a thank you page for anyone who has submitted a form and three blog pages with content on Ideation, Customer Discovery and Fundraising.

-   **Navigation Bar**
    
    -   Featured on all seven pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Blog Section and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
    -   This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
    - The navigation bar displays an active link to inform the user where they are currently on the website to assist navigation.
    - The navigation bar collapses into a burger menu on smaller devices to avoid excessive space being consumed by the navigation area.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#features-left-to-implement)Features Left to Implement

-   I would have liked to connect the newsletter forms to an actual mailing list to enable users to receive new content on a regular basis. This would involve creating a backend database and APIs to collect and store the user information, in addition to integrating with a mailing software suce as MailChimp in order to email new subscribers. 
-  I would like to make a full blog editor where I can quickly add new blog pages with the same layout and style without having to manually create a new page by writing HTML and CSS. This would involve creating an admin page where I could write new articles and publish them to the site. Information on how to do this is provided in the following [link](https://dev.to/themodernweb/fullstack-how-to-create-a-working-blogging-website-with-pure-html-css-and-js-in-2021-9di.).


## [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#testing)Testing

To ensure the site functions appropriately I conducted a number of tests. This includes HTML, CSS and Javascript testing. 

### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#validator-testing)Validator Testing

-   HTML
    -   No errors were returned when passing through the official  [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbom-98.github.io%2Fproject_1%2Findex.html)
-   CSS
    -   No errors were found when passing through the official  [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbom-98.github.io%2Fproject_1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

## [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#deployment)Deployment

-   The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    -   In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    -   From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    -   Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#content)Content


- Inspiration on the hero section and the layout of the blog pages was taken from [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/index.html).  A lot of the design was customized and not copied, in particular the hero section, however the wireframe was initially inspired from the Interneting is Hard website design.
- General instructions on how to create a toggleable tab navigation section was taken from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp). The general logic behind the code was learned from this site, but the implemented version was highly customized and altered to suit the site. 
-  How to structure and style the logic form was taken from [Coding Stella's Codepen](https://codepen.io/codingstella/pen/LYJKQxB). Small adjustments to the form inputs and colour were added to the style. 
- How to create a sticky aside was learned from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sticky_header.asp). I reverse engineered how the sticky navigation operated from that website and copied some of the element IDs - however the section was styled very differently and javascript logic was added with event listeners to ensure the side navigation disappeared once the user scrolled down far enough on the site. 
- The actual writing in the blogs were generated by [chat-gpt](https://chat.openai.com/) to produce some content that could be used in the pages.
- How to generally style the cards used in the blog home page was learned from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp). The general layout for the cards was drawn from here, however I had to use flexbox to reorganise the elements within the cards and completely change the design. 
- The responsive website mockups were generated using [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://bom-98.github.io/project_1/index.html).
- Adobe Illustrator was used to edit the .EPS documents created by [catalyststuff](https://www.freepik.com/author/catalyststuff).
- Visual Studio Code was the IDE used to create the website.
- I used [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), an extension within Visual Studio Code to visualise and test my website as I was creating it. 


### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#media)Media

 -   The images used throughout the website were sourced from Freepik, specifically the author [catalyststuff](https://www.freepik.com/author/catalyststuff).
-   The logo was generated using [Tailor Brands](https://studio.tailorbrands.com/).

## Table of Contents

The Startup Academy is a blog for guiding new founders on best practices for achieving product-market fit. The blog is targeted towards startup founders, particularly new founders in Dublin, Ireland. The goal of the website is to distill as much knowledge as possible into articles and present them in a logical order for founders to follow. If a founder is running a company that is already past some of the stages discussed in the blog, they can easily navigate and identify what the next problem area they should explore would be.

## Features

The Startup Academy website features a dedicated homepage where founders can instantly navigate to all the relevant resources contained on the site. This includes a responsive navigation bar, a tab section where users can toggle between blog content to arrive at the area most relevant to them, a form to sign up to the newsletter, a thank you page for anyone who has submitted a form and three blog pages with content on Ideation, Customer Discovery and Fundraising.

-   **Navigation Bar**
    
    -   Featured on all seven pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Blog Section and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
    -   This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
    - The navigation bar displays an active link to inform the user where they are currently on the website to assist navigation.
    - The navigation bar collapses into a burger menu on smaller devices to avoid excessive space being consumed by the navigation area.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#features-left-to-implement)Features Left to Implement

-   I would have liked to connect the newsletter forms to an actual mailing list to enable users to receive new content on a regular basis.
-  I would like to make a full blog editor so that I can quickly add new blog pages with the same layout and style without having to manually create a new page. Information on how to do this is provided in the following links: 
	- https://dev.to/themodernweb/fullstack-how-to-create-a-working-blogging-website-with-pure-html-css-and-js-in-2021-9di.

- General instructions on how to create a toggleable tab navigation section was taken from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp). The general logic behind the code was learned from this site, but the implemented version was highly customized and altered to suit the site. 
-  How to structure and style the logic form was taken from [Coding Stella's Codepen](https://codepen.io/codingstella/pen/LYJKQxB). Small adjustments to the form inputs and colour were added to the style. 
- How to create a sticky aside was learned from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sticky_header.asp)
-The actual writing in the blogs were generated by chat-gpt to produce some content that could be used in the pages.
-How to generally style the cards used in the blog home page was learned from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp)


### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template#media)Media

 -   The images used throughout the website were sourced from Freepik, specifically the author [catalyststuff](https://www.freepik.com/author/catalyststuff)
-   The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

-   One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through  [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)  by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message
    
    -   Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
-   When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
    
    -   For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
-   Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
    
    -   [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
    -   [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
    -   [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
